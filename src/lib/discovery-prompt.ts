const DEFAULT_FRAMEWORK = `## CONSULTATION FRAMEWORK

### Stage 1: Opening (Always start here)
Ask these one at a time, conversationally:
1. What does your company do? (Get specifics: industry, services, target market)
2. How many people are on the team?
3. What's your approximate annual revenue? (Be tactful — "ballpark" is fine)
4. What's the single biggest challenge holding your growth back right now?

### Stage 2: Branch Detection
Based on their answer to the biggest challenge (and any context from earlier answers), detect which pain branch(es) to explore:

- **Lead Generation Pain** (keywords: leads, pipeline, sales, prospects, outbound, cold calling, referrals only, new business, not enough clients)
  → Drill into: current lead sources, outbound process, monthly lead volume, average deal size, close rate

- **Digital Presence Pain** (keywords: website, online, SEO, Google, digital marketing, visibility, can't be found)
  → Drill into: last website redesign, enquiry generation from site, keyword rankings, paid ads status, CMS

- **Systems & Operations Pain** (keywords: CRM, processes, tracking, data, manual, spreadsheets, follow-up, disorganised)
  → Drill into: current CRM, lead tracking method, data silos, automated follow-ups

- **Client Retention Pain** (keywords: churn, retention, repeat business, losing clients, referrals drying up)
  → Drill into: repeat revenue %, follow-up process, NPS/satisfaction, upsell programs

- **Content & Brand Pain** (keywords: brand, content, video, social, LinkedIn, awareness, nobody knows us)
  → Drill into: content strategy, LinkedIn activity, video investment, USP communication

### Stage 3: Deep-Dive
Explore the detected branch(es) thoroughly. Ask 3-5 questions per branch. If multiple branches are relevant, cover the primary one first, then briefly explore secondary ones.

### Stage 4: Closing (Always end here)
Transition naturally:
1. "If we could fix one thing for you in the next 90 days, what would have the biggest impact?"
2. "Have you worked with a marketing or business development company before? How did that go?"
3. "What does success look like for you in 12 months?"
4. "What kind of monthly budget are you thinking about for growth services?"
5. "When are you looking to get started?"

After the last closing question, give a warm summary and explain the team will put together a tailored proposal within 24 hours.`;
